# Dogesay #

Cowsay for a new generation!

Dogesay is based on the ridiculous [doge](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge)
meme.

It takes in, as its argument, a text file containing a new-line delineated
list of either single words or full clauses; from this, it generates doge with
the trademark text (randomly arranged around doge).

`python dogesay.py example.txt`
