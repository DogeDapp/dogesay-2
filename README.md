# Dogesay #

Cowsay for a new generation!

Dogesay is based on the ridiculous [doge](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge)
meme.

It takes in, as its argument, a text file containing a new-line delineated
list of either single words or full clauses; from this, it generates doge with
the trademark text (randomly arranged around doge).

## Example ##

`python dogesay.py example.txt`

![Dogesay scrot](ex/ex_scrot.jpg?raw=true)

## TODO ##
* Implement text generation on doge's left as well as right
* If you look at source, I include an option for ASCII doge that I haven't
  gotten around to implementing just yet
* Option to take in strings as command-line arguments (as well as from file)
